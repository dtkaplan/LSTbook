\title{Convert a model or a data frame to a skeleton}
\usage{
model_skeleton(mod, data = NULL, ncont = 3, nfirstcont = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{mod}{A fitted model \strong{or} a tilde expression describing a model structure, e.g. \code{outcome ~ vara+varb}.}

\item{data}{a data frame. Relevant only when \code{mod} is a tilde expression}

\item{ncont}{minimum number of levels at which to represent continuous variables. (More levels
may be added to "prettify" the choices. See \code{\link[=pretty]{pretty()}}.)}

\item{nfirstcont}{Like \code{ncont}, but for the first explanatory variable if it is categorical. This variable is mapped
to the horizontal axis and so should have many levels to produce a smooth graph. (Default: 50)}
}
\description{
Only explanatory variables are included in the result.
