  ...,
  k = 10,

  error_type = c("default", "mse", "sse", "mad", "LL", "mLL", "dev", "class_error"),

\arguments{
\item{...}{one or more models on which to perform the cross validation}

\item{k}{the k in k-fold. cross-validation will use k-1/k of the data for training.}

\item{ntrials}{how many random partitions to make. Each partition will be one case in the
output of the function}

\item{error_type}{The kind of output to produce from each cross-validation. See \code{\link{model_pe}} for details.}

\item{blockwise}{When TRUE carries out the trials in a blockwise mode, suitable for time series.}

\description{
Compare models with k-fold cross validation
}
\details{
The purpose of cross-validation is to provide "new" data on which to test a model's
performance. In k-fold cross-validation, the data set used to train the model is broken into
new training and testing data. This is accomplished simply by using most of the data for training while
reserving the remaining data for evaluating the model: testing. Rather than training a single model, k models
are trained, each with its own particular testing set. The testing sets in the k models are arranged to cover the
whole of the data set. On each of the k testing sets, a performance output is calculated. Which output is
most appropriate depends on the kind of model: regression model or classifier. The most basic measure is the mean square error: the
difference between the actual response variable in the testing data and the output of the model
when presented with inputs from the testing data. This is appropriate in many regression models.

The blockwise mode is intended for time-series like data, where successive rows may be correlated. Rather than
picking each k block as a random sample of rows, adjacent rows will be used for model evaluation.
