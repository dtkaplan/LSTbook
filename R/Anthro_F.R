#' Anthropometric data from college-aged women
#'
#' Percentage of body fat, age, weight, height, body mass index and fourteen
#' circumference measurements are given for 184 college women ages 18-25.
#' Body fat was accurately determined by an underwater weighing technique
#' which requires special equipment and training of the individuals
#' conducting the process. Circumference measurements were made to the
#' nearest 0.1 cm using a cloth tape in complete contact with the skin
#' but without compression of the soft tissues. The measurement process,
#' described somewhat incompletely below, is described in greater detail in
#' Slack (1997) who used the standards recommended by Lohman, Roche and
#' Martrell (1988).
